## Introduction
[ The introduction of the Supplementary Specification provides an overview of the entire document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of this Supplementary Specification. 
The Supplementary Specification captures the system requirements that are not readily captured in the use cases of the use-case model. Such requirements include: 
    •	Legal and regulatory requirements, including application standards. 
    •	Quality attributes of the system to be built, including usability, reliability, performance, and supportability requirements. 
    •	Other requirements such as operating systems and environments, compatibility requirements, and design constraints.]

## Purpose
[Specify the purpose of this Supplementary Specification.]

## Scope 
- This Supplementary Specification applies to the Canvas/Moodle LTI addon which will be developed Group 2 of the Fall 2018 Computer Science Capstone offered at Baylor University. Group 2 will develop this LTI extension to interface with an existing Canvas/Moodle instance. 
- The LTI extension will enable students to submit course outlines and quizzes electronically. This add-on will have custom text editing capabilities, as well as allow students to create custom student sets for quiz submission. 
This specification defines the non-functional requirements of the system; such as reliability, usability, performance, and supportability as well as functional requirements that are common across a number of use cases. (The functional requirements are defined in the Use Case Specifications.)


## Definitions, Acronyms, and Abberviations 
[This subsection provides the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the Supplementary Specification. This information may be provided by reference to the project’s Glossary.]

## Overview 
[This subsection describes what the rest of the Supplementary Specification contains and explains how the document is organized.]

## Functionalility
[This section describes the functional requirements of the system for those requirements which are expressed in the natural language style. For many applications, this may constitute the bulk of the SRS Package and thought should be given to the organization of this section. This section is typically organized by feature, but alternative organization methods, for example organization by user or organization by subsystem, may also be appropriate. Functional requirements may include feature sets, capabilities, and security.
Where application development tools, such as requirements tools, modeling tools, and so on, are employed to capture the functionality, this section document will refer to the availability of that data, indicating the location and name of the tool used to capture the data.]


## Usability
This section lists all of those requirements that relate to, or affect, the usability of the system.


## Design for Ease-of-Use
The user interface of the LTI extension shall be designed for ease-of-use and shall be appropriate for a computer-literate user community with no additional training on the System
## Online Help 
The LTI extension shall have built-in online help for the user. Online Help shall include step by step instructions on using the various components

## Reliability
This section lists all reliability requirements.
## Availability
The LTI extensions shall be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There shall be no more than 4% down time.
## Mean Time Between Failures
Mean Time Between Failures shall exceed 300 hours.


## Performance 
[The performance characteristics of the system should be outlined in this section. Include specific response times. Where applicable, reference related Use Cases by name.
- Response time for a transaction(average, maximum)
- Throughput (for example, transactions per second)
- Capacity (for example, the number of customers or transactions the system can accommodate)
- Degradation modes (what is the acceptable mode of operation when the system has been degraded in some manner)
- Resource use: memory, disk, communications, and so forth]


## Supportability
[This section indicates any requirements that will enhance the supportability or maintainability of the system being built, including coding standards, naming conventions, class libraries, maintenance access, maintenance utilities.]

## Design Constraints 
[This section needs to indicate any design constraints on the system being built. Design constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered to. Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased components, class libraries, and so on.]

## Online User Documentation and Help System Requirements
[Describes the requirements, if any, for on-line user documentation, help systems, help about notices, and so on.]

## Purchased Components
[This section describes any purchased components to be used with the system , any applicable licensing or usage restrictions, and any associated compatibility/interoperability or interface standards.]


## Interfaces
[This section defines the interfaces that must be supported by the application. It should contain adequate specificity, protocols, ports and logical addresses, and so forth, so that the software can be developed and verified against the interface requirements.]

## Licensing Requirements
[Defines any licensing enforcement requirements or other usage restriction requirements that are to be exhibited by the software.]

## Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices
[This section describes any necessary legal disclaimers, warranties, copyright notices, patent notice, wordmark, trademark, or logo compliance issues for the software.]

## Applicable Standards
[This section describes by reference any applicable standards and the specific sections of any such standards that apply to the system being described. For example, this could include legal, quality and regulatory standards, industry standards for usability, interoperability, internationalization, operating system compliance, and so forth.]
